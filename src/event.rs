//! Event handling.
//!
//! This module provides a plugin for handling events, and a wrapper around
//! `crossterm::event::KeyEvent`.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! use bevy::{app::AppExit, prelude::*};
//! use bevy_ratatui::event::KeyEvent;
//! use crossterm::event::KeyCode;
//!
//! fn keyboard_input_system(mut events: EventReader<KeyEvent>, mut exit: EventWriter<AppExit>) {
//!     for event in events.read() {
//!         match event.code {
//!             KeyCode::Char('q') | KeyCode::Esc => {
//!                 exit.send_default();
//!             }
//!             _ => {}
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
